# Glossa

Glossa is a language localisation library for software.

[![Documentation](https://docs.rs/glossa/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/glossa)

[![Apache-2 licensed](https://img.shields.io/crates/l/glossa.svg)](./License)

You can easily load localised resources using `LangRes` and retrieve localised text using `.get()` or `.get_with_kv()` (depending on the syntax of `fluent`).

Before we get started, we may have some questions about it.

- Why should I use it?
- Can't I just use configuration files for simple localisation?

Glossa currently uses the loader of [fluent-templates](https://docs.rs/fluent-templates), and the so-called localised resources are actually some `ftl (fluent)` files.

You can think of `fluent` as a type of configuration file, except that it uses a domain-specific language (DSL). It may be more suitable for localisation than conventional configuration languages.

These advantages allow us to increase efficiency and productivity.

Moreover, since the open-source **Mozilla Pontoon** supports `fluent`, we can set up our own **Pontoon** platform using `docker` or other technologies. This allows everyone to participate in localisation together ~~and make the world a better place~~.

These are actually the benefits of fluent.

If you want more granular control over your resources, you might want to check out [fluent](https://docs.rs/fluent).
If you're just interested in this crate, you can keep reading.

If you have simple localisation needs, using conventional configuration files is also a good option.

This mainly depends on your requirements and preferences.

## Get started

Firstly, we need to add some dependencies:

```sh
cargo add glossa
cargo add lang-id
cargo add once_cell
```

If you don't need a custom language ID and would rather use automatic detection, you can skip the `lang-id` dependency.

If you don't require an `ArcLoader` with a global variable or static lifetime, you can omit adding `once_cell`.

Although the following example may appear lengthy, it actually consists of simple components.

```rust
use glossa::{
    resource::loader::{new_arc_loader, ArcLoader},
    LangRes,
};
use once_cell::sync::Lazy;
use std::{
    fs::{self, File},
    io::{self, Write},
    path::{Path, PathBuf},
};

/// This function is used to create a directory and write the contents to the relevant file.
//
// Note: In practice, you don't actually need to create such a function.
// It's only written here for tutorial purposes.
fn create_l10n_text<P: AsRef<Path>>(
    path: P,
    append: bool,
    contents: &str,
) -> io::Result<()> {
    let path = path.as_ref();

    fs::create_dir_all(
            path.parent()
                .expect(r#"Please bring your parent to meet meüòÖ.
                Just joke, this path doesn't seem to contain the previous level, please double check.
                For example: for `main.ftl`, you need to store it in "en/main.ftl" or "en-GB/main.ftl".
                (The lang-id can be changed at will)"#),
        )?;

    let mut file = File::options()
        .create(true)
        .append(append)
        .write(true)
        .open(path)?;

    writeln!(file, "{contents}")
}

fn main() {
    // Specify the fluent file for en(en-Latn-US)
    // On Windows, it's "locales\en\test.ftl".
    // On Unix, it's "locales/en/test.ftl".
    let mut arr = ["locales", "en", "test.ftl"];
    let mut file = PathBuf::from_iter(&arr);
    const IO_MSG: &str = "I/O Error, failed to create/write the file";

    // We've created a file with only one line of data, where the key is "welcome" and the value is "Welcome to glossaü•≥".
    create_l10n_text(file, false, "welcome = Welcome to glossaü•≥").expect(IO_MSG);

    // We change the second element from "en" to "de" to start our German localisation.
    if let Some(p) = arr.iter_mut().nth(1) {
        *p = "de"
    }
    file = PathBuf::from_iter(&arr);

    // This is the localised content in German([de] de-Latn-DE: Deutsch, Lateinisch, Deutschland) that we'll use for testing later on.
    create_l10n_text(file, false, "welcome = Willkommen bei glossaüòö")
        .expect(IO_MSG);

    // We change the second element to "zh"
    if let Some(p) = arr.iter_mut().nth(1) {
        *p = "zh"
    }
    file = PathBuf::from_iter(arr);

    // This is the localised content in Simplified Chinese.([zh] zh-Hans-CN: ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá, ‰∏≠ÂõΩ)
    create_l10n_text(file, false, "welcome = Ê¨¢Ëøé‰ΩøÁî® glossaü•∞").expect(IO_MSG);

    const ERR_MSG: &str = "Failed to create arc loader";

    // We've created a loader that reads localised resources at runtime.
    static LOADER: Lazy<ArcLoader> =
        Lazy::new(|| new_arc_loader(Path::new("locales"), None).expect(ERR_MSG));

    // Although there is only Loader, not Lang, `from()` will automatically set your system language to the language of `LangRes`.
    let res = LangRes::from(&LOADER);

    // You can think of `.get()` as the equivalent of `.get()` for a HashMap, but the difference is that it returns a `Result` instead of an `Option`.
    let text = res.get("welcome").expect(
        r#"Failed to get the value of "welcome" from locales/[lang-id]/test.ftl."#,
    );

    // Since I'm not sure what language your system is in, I'm using match to determine the language, and then `assert_eq`.
    // In fact, this step is not needed at all.
    // When you call `get()`, the text will already be the localised text you want.
    // If it can't be found, then it's probably not what you want, but it will automatically use fallback. e.g. zh-Hant-HK -> zh-Hant -> zh -> en
    match res.language.as_str() {
        "zh" => assert_eq!(text, "Ê¨¢Ëøé‰ΩøÁî® glossaü•∞"),
        "de" => assert_eq!(text, "Willkommen bei glossaüòö"),
        _ => assert_eq!(text, "Welcome to glossaü•≥"),
    }
}
```

After reading this, you might think: why not just use a configuration file instead of all this?

In reality, fluent has more advanced syntax than just "k = v".

Don't worry, let's take it step by step.

Let's assume the following file exists: **locales/en/test2.ftl**

> Although we could use `create_l10n_text()` above to write the text to a file, for simplicity's sake, we'll just paste the content here!

```fluent
time-period = { $period ->
        *[morning] Good morning
        [evening] Good evening
}

gender = { $attr ->
        [male] Mr.
        *[female] Ms.
}
# [walmart-bag]

greetings = { time-period }! { gender }{ $name }
```

Since `greetings` has multiple parameters, we cannot use `get()`.  
We need to use `get_with_kv()`.

```rust
    let text = res
        .get_with_kv(
            "greetings",
            [
                ("period", "evening"),
                ("name", "Alice"),
                ("attr", "unknown"),
            ],
        )
        .expect(r#"Failed to get "greetings"! "#);
```

Let's take a guess at what the content of `text` is.

Is it "Good evening! unknown Alice"?

No, because `*` is the default option. If you pass in an unknown value, it automatically becomes the default value.

Let's test it using `assert_eq`!

```rust
assert_eq!(text, "Good evening! Ms.Alice");
```

Let's give another example, this time in Japanese (ja-Jpan-JP).

Since using `from()` will automatically detect our system language, we'll use `with_arc()` here to specify the language and ArcLoader.

```rust
let res = LangRes::with_arc(unsafe { lang_id::consts::get_ja() }, &LOADER);
```

Create a new fileÔºö **locales/ja/test.ftl**

```fluent
time-period = { $period ->
        [morning] „Åä„ÅØ„Çà„ÅÜ„Åî„Åñ„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åô
        *[evening] „Åì„Çì„Å∞„Çì„ÅØ
}

appellation = { $attr ->
        *[male] „Åï„Çì
        [young-male] Âêõ
        [old-male] „ÅäÁà∫„Åï„Çì
        [noble-man] Êßò
        [noble-young-male] „ÅäÂùä„Å°„ÇÉ„Åæ
        [female] „Åï„Çì
        [young-female] „Å°„ÇÉ„Çì
        [old-female] „ÅäÂ©Ü„Åï„Çì
        [noble-young-female] „ÅäÂ¨¢Êßò
}

greetings = { time-period }„ÄÅ{ $name }{ appellation }
```

Then we can use the `get_with_kv()` function.

```rust
    let text = res
        .get_with_kv(
            "greetings",
            [
                ("period", "morning"),
                ("name", "Alice"),
                ("attr", "noble-young-female"),
            ],
        )
        .expect(r#"Failed to get "greetings"! "#);
```

Using `println!("{text}")`, we can see that the output is `„Åä„ÅØ„Çà„ÅÜ„Åî„Åñ„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åô„ÄÅAlice„ÅäÂ¨¢Êßò`

After reading the content above, I believe you have a clear understanding of it now.

However, this is only the beginning. If you want to learn more about fluent syntax, you can visit [Project Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/).  
We won't go into further detail here.

## Language Resource

Let's learn about what `resource::LangResource` is.

| Member Variable | Type                      | Description                                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`            | `LangID`                  | Represents the ID of the language resource.                       |
| `loader`        | `FluentLoader<'a>`        | Represents the loader for Fluent resources.                       |
| `chain`         | `OnceCell<FallbackChain>` | Represents the fallback chain for alternative language resources. |

### ID

ID refers to language identifier, such as `en`, `en-001`, and `en-Latn-001` are all valid lang-ids.

`en` refers to en-Latn-US, not en-GB.

`001` refers to the world.

> The related rules come from Unicode CLDR (Unicode Common Locale Data Repository) version 42.0.0.

If you use `from()` to create a struct, you don't need to worry about the ID field because it will automatically obtain your system's language.

> For a detailed list of lang-ids, you can refer to [lang-id](https://github.com/2moe/lang-id).

### loader

`FluentLoader` is an enum type that currently supports `StaticLoader` and `ArcLoader`, both of which come from fluent-templates.

Perhaps more loaders can be added in the future.

| Variable   | Type                    | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Static`   | `&'static StaticLoader` | Represents a static Fluent loader that loads Fluent resources at compile time.                                                                                      |
| `Arc`      | `&'a ArcLoader`         | Represents a reference-counted smart pointer-based Fluent loader that allows loading resources at runtime. Both `'static ArcLoader` and `'a ArcLoader` can be used. |
| `ArcOwned` | `Arc<ArcLoader>`        | Represents a reference-counted smart pointer-based Fluent loader with ownership. The main difference from `&'a ArcLoader` is that it has ownership.                 |

The `FluentLoader` enum represents two types of Fluent loaders: the `StaticLoader`, which loads Fluent resources (i18n/l10n resources) at compile time, and the `ArcLoader`, which allows loading resources at runtime using both `'static ArcLoader` and `'a ArcLoader`. The `ArcOwned` variant is another type of `ArcLoader` that has ownership.

This enum is used to specify the type of Fluent loader when initializing a `LangResource` struct.

Note: `static_loader` comes from fluent-templates, you can use the same syntax as it.

```rust
use glossa::resource::loader::static_loader;

static_loader! {
    static LOADER = {
        locales: "locales",
        fallback_language: "en",
        customise: |bundle| bundle.set_use_isolating(false),
    };
}
```

### chain

`chain` can be lazily initialised. By default, it won't be initialised automatically when not needed and will only be initialised once when needed.

For example, if your language ID is "en" and all the localisation resources match, then it won't automatically initialise the fallback chain.

On the other hand, if your language ID is `zh-Hant-MO` and there are no matches, then it will automatically generate a fallback chain based on the resource list.

- For languages with the same name, scripts have higher priority than regions.
  - If the current resource list is `["zh", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant-HK", "zh-Hans-MO"]`, then `zh-Hant-HK` has higher priority than `zh-Hans-MO`.

If you need to customise the fallback chain, use `set_chain_once()` before calling `get()` or `get_with_kv()`.

Once the fallback chain is initialised, you cannot modify its value, but you can replace it with a new `OnceCell` instance.
